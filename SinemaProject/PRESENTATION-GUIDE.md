## 💡 Talking Points

### Opening Statements

**Strong Opening:**
> "Today I'm presenting a comprehensive Cinema Management System that handles everything from ticket sales to member management. This isn't just a booking system - it's a complete cinema operations platform with dynamic pricing, real-time seat reservations, and detailed analytics."

**Problem Statement:**
> "Cinema operators face challenges in managing complex pricing policies, preventing double-bookings, coordinating between online and box office sales, and tracking business performance. This system solves all these problems in one integrated solution."

### Key Value Propositions

1. **For Cinema Owners:**
   - Increase revenue with dynamic pricing
   - Reduce operational costs with automation
   - Gain insights with comprehensive reports
   - Scale easily to multiple halls

2. **For Box Office Staff:**
   - Fast ticket sales interface
   - No training required - intuitive design
   - Handle rush hours efficiently
   - Quick member lookup

3. **For Customers:**
   - Book online anytime, anywhere
   - Choose exact seats they want
   - Transparent pricing
   - Instant confirmation

### Technical Strengths

**Why This Architecture?**
> "I chose Clean Architecture because it ensures the business logic is independent of frameworks and databases. This means we can swap out React for another framework, or SQL Server for PostgreSQL, without rewriting the core business rules."

**Why CQRS?**
> "CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) separates read and write operations. This improves performance and scalability. For example, generating reports doesn't impact ticket sales performance."

**Why JWT?**
> "JWT tokens enable stateless authentication, which means the API can scale horizontally without session management. The refresh token mechanism provides security without forcing users to log in repeatedly."

### Technical Achievements

- ✅ **Clean Architecture** - Maintainable and testable
- ✅ **CQRS + MediatR** - Scalable command/query handling
- ✅ **Entity Framework Core** - Type-safe database access
- ✅ **JWT Authentication** - Secure and stateless
- ✅ **Redux Toolkit** - Predictable state management
- ✅ **TypeScript** - Type-safe frontend code
- ✅ **Background Jobs** - Automated maintenance tasks
- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging** - Serilog with file output

## ❓ Technical Questions & Answers

### Architecture & Design

**Q: Why did you choose Clean Architecture?**
> **A:** Clean Architecture provides clear separation of concerns and makes the system highly maintainable and testable. The business logic in the Domain and Application layers is independent of frameworks, databases, and UI. This means:
> - Easy to unit test business rules
> - Can swap databases without affecting business logic
> - Can replace React with another framework without touching the backend
> - New team members can understand the structure quickly

**Q: What is CQRS and why use it?**
> **A:** CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) separates operations that modify data (Commands) from operations that read data (Queries). Benefits:
> - Queries can be optimized separately from commands
> - Commands enforce business rules
> - Easier to scale - read and write operations can be scaled independently
> - Clear responsibility - each handler does one thing
> - Example: `CreateScreeningCommand` vs `GetScreeningQuery`

**Q: How do you prevent race conditions in seat booking?**
> **A:** We use a seat hold system with database transactions:
> 1. User selects seats → Creates temporary "holds" with client token
> 2. Holds are unique per seat (database constraint)
> 3. Only the client that holds seats can reserve them
> 4. Holds expire after 10 minutes (background job)
> 5. Reservations are atomic operations in transactions
> This ensures no two customers can book the same seat.

**Q: How does your pricing system work?**
> **A:** We have 8 dynamic pricing policies that stack:
> - **Base price** per ticket type (Full/Student/Child)
> - **Day policy**: Weekends cost more
> - **Time policy**: Matinee < Evening < Night
> - **Member policy**: VIP members get discounts
> - **Holiday policy**: Special rates on holidays
> - **Movie policy**: Blockbusters can have premiums
> - Calculated in real-time using the Strategy pattern
> - Example: Weekend + Evening + VIP = 20% increase - 10% VIP discount

### Backend Technology

**Q: Why .NET 9 instead of .NET 6 or 8?**
> **A:** .NET 9 provides:
> - Latest performance improvements (faster JSON serialization)
> - New C# 13 features
> - Better minimal API support
> - Long-term support
> - Industry-standard for enterprise applications

**Q: How do you handle authentication?**
> **A:** JWT (JSON Web Token) with refresh tokens:
> 1. User logs in → Receives access token (15 min) + refresh token (7 days)
> 2. Access token sent with each request
> 3. When access token expires → Use refresh token to get new access token
> 4. Refresh tokens stored in database, can be revoked
> 5. Passwords hashed with ASP.NET Core Identity
> 6. Role-based claims in JWT payload

**Q: What about security?**
> **A:** Multiple layers:
> - **Authentication**: JWT with refresh tokens
> - **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
> - **Password Security**: ASP.NET Core Identity with hashing
> - **SQL Injection**: Entity Framework uses parameterized queries
> - **CORS**: Configured to allow only specific origins
> - **HTTPS**: Enforced in production
> - **Input Validation**: FluentValidation for all commands
> - **Rate Limiting**: Can be added easily

**Q: How do you handle database migrations?**
> **A:** Entity Framework Core migrations:
> - Migrations are version-controlled (in git)
> - `dotnet ef migrations add` creates migration
> - `dotnet ef database update` applies to database
> - Can generate SQL scripts for production
> - Can rollback migrations if needed
> - Database schema evolves with code

### Frontend Technology

**Q: Why React instead of Angular or Vue?**
> **A:** React provides:
> - Large ecosystem and community
> - Component reusability
> - Virtual DOM for performance
> - Hooks for clean state management
> - TypeScript support
> - Redux Toolkit for predictable state
> - Fast development with Vite

**Q: Why Redux Toolkit?**
> **A:** Redux Toolkit simplifies state management:
> - Centralized application state
> - Predictable state updates
> - Time-travel debugging (Redux DevTools)
> - Easy async operations with createAsyncThunk
> - Reduces boilerplate compared to plain Redux
> - Excellent TypeScript integration

**Q: How do you handle API calls?**
> **A:** Centralized API service with Axios:
> - Single source of truth: `services/api.ts`
> - Automatic JWT token injection
> - Automatic token refresh on 401
> - Error handling and retry logic
> - TypeScript types for all responses
> - Easy to mock for testing

### Performance & Scalability

**Q: How does this scale?**
> **A:** Multiple strategies:
> - **Stateless API**: Can add more API servers behind load balancer
> - **Database**: SQL Server supports clustering and replication
> - **Caching**: Can add Redis for frequently accessed data
> - **CDN**: Static frontend assets served from CDN
> - **Background Jobs**: Quartz.NET handles scheduled tasks
> - **Async/Await**: Non-blocking I/O throughout

**Q: What about performance?**
> **A:** Optimizations implemented:
> - **Database**: Proper indexes on frequently queried columns
> - **EF Core**: Includes/projections to prevent N+1 queries
> - **Frontend**: Code splitting with React.lazy
> - **API**: Response caching where appropriate
> - **Background Jobs**: Heavy operations run asynchronously
> - Can add Redis caching as needed

**Q: How many concurrent users can it handle?**
> **A:** Depends on infrastructure, but architecture supports:
> - Hundreds of concurrent users on modest hardware
> - Thousands with proper scaling (load balancer, multiple servers)
> - Database connection pooling prevents bottlenecks
> - Seat hold system prevents race conditions even under load
> - Can be load tested with tools like JMeter or k6

### Testing

**Q: What kind of testing did you implement?**
> **A:** Multiple testing layers:
> - **Unit Tests**: Test business logic in isolation (Sinema.UnitTests)
> - **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints with test database (Sinema.IntegrationTests)
> - **Example**: Testing pricing policies, reservation creation, member approval
> - Used xUnit testing framework
> - Can run: `dotnet test`

**Q: How do you test the frontend?**
> **A:** Multiple approaches:
> - Component testing with React Testing Library (can be added)
> - Redux state testing
> - Manual testing with dev tools
> - TypeScript catches many errors at compile time
